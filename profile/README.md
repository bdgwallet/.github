## Resources

### [BDK Manager](https://github.com/bdgwallet/bdkmanager-swift)
This package makes it easier to work with [bdk-swift](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-swift) on iOS by providing good defaults, simple setup and modern SwiftUI compatible convenience functions and variables.  

More to come.
This is WORK IN PROGRESS, not yet ready for production.
